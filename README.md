## ðŸ‘‹ Hi â€” Welcome to My Data Analytics Portfolio

I'm currently transitioning into data analytics after studying computer science. Over time, Iâ€™ve developed a strong interest in uncovering insights from data to solve real world problems and drive smarter decisions. This portfolio showcases my independent projects as I build hands on experience with tools like SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python.

Each project here is something I designed, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized from start to finish, with a focus on both business impact and clear storytelling. Iâ€™m constantly learning and refining my skills, and this space is where I document that growth.
