## Welcome to My Data Analytics Portfolio

Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew. I studied computer science, and over time, Iâ€™ve grown really interested in using data to solve real world problems and drive better decisions. This portfolio highlights the projects Iâ€™ve worked on independently to sharpen my skills and apply data analytics in practical ways.

Each project here was completed end to end, from data cleaning and exploration to analysis and visualization. Iâ€™ve used tools like SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python to dig into datasets, extract insights, and communicate findings in a way that supports business thinking.

Iâ€™m always learning, and this space is where I share that ongoing progress.
